NDL is a python package that can build NJOY (http://www.njoy21.io/) input with default settings and run NJOY in order to convert the nuclear data files from
[ENDF-6 format](https://www.oecd-nea.org/dbdata/data/manual-endf/endf102.pdf) into ACE files that can be employed in Serpent-2 (http://montecarlo.vtt.fi/) or MCNP (https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) codes.
The primary objective of the code is to process neutron and photo-atomic ENDF-6 files for Monte Carlo simulations.

## Installation

To install NDL, run the following command:
